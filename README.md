# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  Artemis financial is a financial consulting company that provides services for savings, retirement, investments and insurance for their users and clients. They speifically wanted to ensure security of communication as well as of their clients sensitive data. 

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

  We were able to implement solutions to the client's security concerns. This included a secure RESTful API, checksum verification, and certificate verification. The security of our clients begins with writing the code to ensure the application staus secure. Secure software helps the client's users to feel secure, as well as the client. It helps to avoid any hard situations of comprimised finanicial data.

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
  I found checksum verification the most difficult, coding it correctly was difficult to me. I enjoyed learning about certificate creation, I will make use of that in the future. 

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

  Since this is financial data that is at risk, I made sure to use the highest levels of security possible. In the future, considering a company as well as their industry will be important for choosing the correct security protocols and forms. 

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I used the Maven Depenency Tool, this helped to check for and identify risk. 

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
